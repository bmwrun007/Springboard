    "##### Question 1: Is the distribution of body temperatures normal?\n",
    "**Answer 1:** There are various statistical tests in existance that can tell, with some degree of certainty, whether a sample of data points was gathered from a probability distribution that is normally distributed. These are generally known as Normality tests [Wikipedia: Normality tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_test). I decided to use the Shapiro-Wilk test to analyze the provided data. The null hypothesis for the test is that the data points are being sampled from a normal distribution. The test returns a Shapiro-Wilk statistic, and a $p$-value. The $p$-value signifies the chance that the sample points could have been gathered from a normal distribution. Thus, if a $p$-value is small (let's call the significance level 5%), then we would reject the null hypothesis and say that the samples were not derived from a normal distribution."

For good measure, we can also use another normality test based on D'Agostino and Pearson's test [Scipy Normaltest function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.normaltest.html#r549). It again uses a null hypothesis that the data points are being sampled from a normal distribution."

Let's say that the null hypothesis is that the mean of the sampling distribution is indeed 98.6, and that the alternate hypothesis is that it is not 98.6. Let's also define a threshold for rejection of the null hypothesis at 5%, meaning that if, given the null hypothesis, there was a 5% chance or less that we could have sampled data in the manner that we did, then we will reject the null hypothesis and declare that the mean of the sampling distribution is unlikely to be 98.6. We will create a $z$-statistic using the mean from our null hypothesis, the observed mean from our sample, and the observed standard deviation from our sample.

    "**Answer 3b:** A one-sample test is appropriate here, because we are trying to determine make inferences about the underlying distribution (via a $z$-test) from a single sample. If we were trying to compare two samples and prove hypotheses surrounding statistics based on the samples (say, if the mean body temperature of men is the same as women), then we would use two-sample tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 3c:** As discussed above, in this situation it's appropriate to use a $z$-statistic. When creating the $z$-statistic, we make the  assumption that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is equal to the standard deviation of our population divided by the square root of our sample size. We then make the assumption, as a result of the Central Limit Theorem, that the standard deviation of our population is equal to the standard deviation of our sample. The final result is a $z$-statistic that we can assume is normally distributed. However, when the sample size is less than 30, then the statistic will not be normally distributed, and will instead take on a distribution known as the $t$-distribution. At this point, the $t$-statistic will be more appropriate to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 3d:** The statistic is calculated in the same way, it's just interpreted in a slightly different way by looking at a $t$-table instead of a $z$-table and by incorporating degrees of freedom into the calculation (in this case, 129, which is the sample size minus 1). For all practical purposes, the result is the same as the $z$-test... That is to say, the chances of getting getting a sample like was gathered when the mean of the sampling distribution is 98.6 is extremely unlikely.\n",
